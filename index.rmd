# Hi, I'm [Jovany Cota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jovany-cota-87aa61178/)!
</center>
  
I am a GIS Analyst from Los Angeles, CA, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Geography, specializing in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), from the University of California, Santa Barbara (Class of 2022). As a dedicated Latino professional, I am passionate about leveraging my expertise in GIS to drive innovative solutions and contribute to impactful projects.

Currently, I am employed as a Field Data Specialist at IDplans, where I have been contributing to saving companies millions of dollars in utility bills since April 2023. I am seeking new opportunities to advance my career in GIS, where I can leverage my skills and grow professionally.

I am particularly interested in positions that offer a balance between professional development and proximity to my home base in Los Angeles, CA. My decision to seek a new role is driven by a desire for greater stability and the ability to be closer to my family.

This website is a collection of GIS projects I have completed. For security and privacy reasons, I am unable to share projects I have been involved in my current and previous positions.
