# Hi, I'm [Jovany Cota](https://github.com/jovanycota)!
</center>
  
I am a Third Year Geography Major from Los Angeles, CA. My interests include: poverty, housing inequality, and education. My hobbies include: soccer, playing chess, and painting. 

Over the course of Summer 2020, I took a class on R. During that time, I became well-equipped on how to use R. For example, I can create plots, graphs, et.. from a specific set of data. Although my term with the class is over, I will continue to learn as much as I can on coding to improve my skills to the best of ability.
