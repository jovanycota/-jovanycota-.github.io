These projects were executed with the help of a variety of programs, including RStudio, ArcGIS, QGIS, Inkscape, GIMP, MATLAB, and GeoDa. Through these experiences, I gained valuable expertise in working with both vector and raster data.

The links below can be used to view the code and process used to create the outputs. 

## The Impact of COVID-19 in Wildfire Impacted Areas
- Understanding whether or not a change in the average of COVID-19 cases is related to the presence of a wildfire nearby. 
- Used anonymous GPS pings from mobile devices of an area to track population flow patterns utilizing Rstudio and ArcGis.

## [Distribution of Dams in U.S.](https://jovanycota.github.io/GEOG-176A-lab/lab-04.html)
- Used different tessellations in order to highlight specific uses of Dams in the U.S. and differentiate between them in a map. 
- Vector data was used in Rstudio for the creation of the maps.
