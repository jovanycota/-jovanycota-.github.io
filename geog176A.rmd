- I learned how to filter objects spatially.
- I learned how to properly use Unary (single) and Binary (multi) feature operations.
- I learned how to formulate functions for my own benefit.
- In this lab, I represented data in different tesselations in order to highlight a certain aspect of dams and differentiate between them
